# Network_Tools
Network Tools APK. 

Although you will not require sudo access or a rooted device to use this, you will need to know what you are doing. 

for certain features you will need to change some of the source and compile the APK. in a future iteration, 
I plan to add functionality to configure these services in a more user friendly manor. 

feature set for version 1 is set to include:
-ping
-tracert
-network speed tests
-web server uptime analysis 
-automated backups to a http site. 

although this is an android app this may appear in a cli desktop application initially (version 0.1) 

V1 will be availble for android and i hope for v2 to include an APK and will not require to be compiled 

i am open to feature requests and bug reports. 

with all that gone enjoy the app and positivie feedback is much appreciated
